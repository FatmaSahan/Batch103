 i started making cake two years ago.i had alot of time.
 because there was covid pandemic..We was at home two during 2 months
 i decided to make  my daughter's birtday cake myself.
 my friend who known taught me tips of making cake...
 my fist experince was not ggod but it was delicios...
 tehen i bought sugar doughfs in different colors an continued
 to experiment  with my daughter ....

 actually you dont need alot of material for making it..
 Flour egg milk sugar sugar doughf mixer oven..this are enoughf

 i like working with sugar doughf because i can be more creative with it.
 i can try to make any object in my mind.. like car,mushroom,clood,baby figur,unicorn..
 if you work with sugar dough ,your hand ,counter and invirement must be cold.
 if not douhf can melt or get soft.you can use starct that stiation
 Also you should be make decorate it after keeping it in the fridge for a day
